# 3D Organelle Distances 
## Background 

As described in Harwood et al., (2020) https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.16219 we imaged 3 different chickpea genotypes with serial block face 
scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM). We furthered our previous work by segmenting the mitochondria and measuring  mesophylly conductance (gm) at 21% and 2% Oxygen. 

## Here is what a chickpea mesophyll cell looks like (chloroplasts are green, mitochondria are red and the cell wall is white)

## Why?
Mesophyll conductance (gm) refers to the passage of CO2 as a gas and a liquid from the sub-stomatal airspace to the site of carboxylation inside the chloroplast. 
gm is influenced by aquaporins, carbonic anhydrase and leaf anatomy. 
An important part of understanding gm is quantifying the role respiration and photorespiration has.
Estimates of gm are influenced by the amount of respiratory and photorespiratory CO2 released from the mitochondria diffusing towards the chloroplasts the ratio of
recapture vs leakage to the atmosphere is not uniform across species and likely related to the position of the mitochondria, the surface are area of mesophyll exposed
to the airspace and the surface area of chloroplast exposed to the airspace. 

## Relevent anatomical information 

We take the 3D images/models and calculate a suite of distance metrics
